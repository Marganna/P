HTML

Unlike a scripting or programming language that uses scripts to perform functions, a markup language uses tags to identify content. 
<p>
Paragraph
</p>

The HTML document has opening and closing HTML tags.
These tags, like the bread in a sandwich, surround everything else:

<html>
…..
<html/>


The head of an HTML file contains all of the non-visual elements that help make the page work.

<html>
<head>.....</head>
</html>

The body tag follows the head tag.

HTML files are text files, so you can use any text editor 

To place a title on the tab describing the web page, add a <title> element to your head section:

In HTML, there is a list of elements that specify text style.

<html>
   <head>
      <title>first page</title>
   </head>
   <body>
      <p>This is regular text </p>
      <p><b> bold text </b></p>
      <p><big> big text </big></p>
      <p><i> italic text </i></p>
      <p><small> small text </small></p>
      <p><strong> strong text </strong></p>
      <p><sub> subscripted text </sub></p>
      <p><sup> superscripted text </sup></p>
      <p><ins> inserted text </ins></p>
      <p><del> deleted text </del></p>
   </body>
</html> 

HTML includes six levels of headings, which are ranked according to importance.
These are <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, and <h6>.

It is not recommended that you use headings just to make the text big or bold, because search engines use headings to
index the web page structure and content.


To create a horizontal line, use the <hr /> tag. 

The browser does not display comments, but they help document the HTML and add descriptions, reminders, and other notes.
<!-- Your comment goes here --> (no ! mark in the end)

HTML documents are made up of HTML elements.

An HTML element is written using a start tag and an end tag, and with the content in between.
HTML documents consist of nested HTML elements
Some HTML elements (like the <br /> tag) do not have end tags.
it’s a separate, single element.

Attributes provide additional information about an element or a tag, while also modifying them. 
Attributes are always specified in the start tag, and they appear in name="value" pairs.
<p align="center"> 
   This text is aligned to center
</p>
