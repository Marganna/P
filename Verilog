Verilog is a Hardware Describtion Language. An HDL is used to describe a digital system 
[microprocessor, memory, flip-flop, network switch...] => any hardware [digita] at any level
could be described by using HDL. Verilog describes digital desigh at behavior level Register
Transfer Level [RTL],Gate level and a switch level.Verilog allows designers to express their
design with behavioral construct, implementing the deasign's later stage into final.
[It may not take more then one week if you know at least 1 programming language].
Verilog as any HDL allows to describe or Bottom-up[each design is performed gate-level.This bottom-up
allows to a new way to hierachical and strutural design methods] or Top-down methodology[allows early 
testing, choise of different technologies but are complicated].

Levels of abstruction

1. Behavioral Level
2.Register transfer
3. Gate level
